    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1. What is a Graph?\n",
    "A Graph is a structure to represent a set of objects where <u>some pairs</u> of objects are \"related\". Each object can be represented by a <b>node</b> and the relation between pairs can be represented by an <b>edge</b> connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./Assets/simple_graph.svg\" alt=\"simple_graph\" width=\"250\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direction of a Graph\n",
    "Based upon the relationship between a pair of nodes, a graph can be categorized between a **Directed Graph** or an **Undirected Graph**.\n",
    "### Directed Graph\n",
    "Directed Graphs are the graphs where the relationship between pairs is directional. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./Assets/directed_graph.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"250\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Undirected Graph\n",
    "Undirected graphs are the graphs where the relationship between pairs do not have a direction. Each of the nodes can be *uniquely* represented with the **Index** of the node and number of **Edges**(relationships) it has with other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./Assets/undirected_graph.svg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"250\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If, $V$ is the set of all vertices and $E$ is the set of all edges.\n",
    "Then the whole grahp, $G$ can be represented as a collection of Vertices$(v)$ and Edges$(e)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$G = \\{(v_{1}, e_{1}),(v_{2}, e_{2}), ... ,(v_{i}, e_{i})\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_{i} \\in V$ and $e_{i} \\in E$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Degree Sequence\n",
    "A **degree** of a vertice $(v)$ is the the number of edges, $(e)$ it has. We can collect of all degrees corresponding to all of the vertices and make a set. E.g. such a *set* for our example graph is : $\\{2,3,2,3,3,1\\}$.\n",
    "The **Degree Sequence** $(d_{G})$ of a Graph $(G)$ is just re-ordering such a *set* in a decreasing sequence. E.g. The degree sequence of our example graph is : $\\{3,3,3,2,2,1\\}$.<br>\n",
    "As we can see here that the degree sequence has same number of elements as the number of vertices in the graph. i.e. if there are $n$ number of nodes in the graph, degree sequence will be a vector of length $n$.\n"

    "## 2. Graph Anonymization\n",
    "In order for an organization to sell or share graph data, the data needs to anonymized in order to respect its privacy policies. In a typical graph database there are *three* types of anonymizations those need to be performed namely *Identitiy Protection*, *Content Protection* and *Link Protection*. <br>\n",
    "$k$-Degree anonimization is a graph modification technique used to anonymize the identity of the nodes with certain *$k$* degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. $k$-Degree Anonymity\n",
    "The main goal of the k-degree anonimization is to make sure that, for each node $(v)$ in the graph $G$ there exists alteast $k-1$ other nodes with the same degree as $v$. <br>\n",
    "If the graph $G$ has $n$ nodes, the *degree sequence $(d_{G})$* of $G$ is an $n$ dimensional vector with, $d_{G}(i) \\ge d_{G}(j)$ for all $j > i$ where $i$ and $i$ are two the indices of the vector $d_{G}$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector $d_{G}$ is *k-anonymous* if every distinct value in $d_{G}$ appears **atleast** $k$ times. The graph $G$ corresponding to $d_{G}$ will be called *$k$-Degree anonymous* **iff** $d_{G}$ is *k-anonymous*.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example graph to be *$3$-Degree anonymous*, we have to modify the degree sequence, $\\{3,3,3,2,2,1\\}$ to $\\{3,3,3,2,2,2\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1. Cost function\n",
    "One of the ways to quantify the anonymization cost is by using a cost function $L_{1}$. Given a graph $G$ and its anonymized form $\\hat{G}$ the cost function $L_{1}$ returns the total cost of turning $d_{G}$ into $d_{\\hat{G}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{1}(d_{G}, d_{\\hat{G}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left|d_{\\hat{G}}(i) - d_{G}(i) \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example graph, the cost of anonymization, $$L_{1} = |3-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| + |2-2| + |2-2| + |2-1| = 1$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. $k$-Degree Anonymization Algorithms\n",
    "The job of a $k$-Degree Anonymization algorithm is to take an input graph $G$ and an integer $k$ to output a $k$-Degree anonymized graph $G'$ keeping the cost $L_{1}$ minimum.<br>\n",
    "$k$-Degree Anonymity can be achieved both by using *dynamic programming* and *greedy-swap* algorithms but anonymization cost $L_{1}$, might differ form one method to another."
